# Multi-Domain-Collaborative-Decoding-of-SSVEP
we propose a multi-domain collaborative decoding algorithm with adaptive visual distraction compensation, comprising two core components: an adaptive label smoothing technique for visual distraction mitigation and a multi-domain joint decoding model.

To explore the intermediate process of network training, we visualized key intermediate layer features of the network. The intermediate features were visualized using the T-SNE algorithm. The visualization of the intermediate features is shown in  "12-class.png" and "40-class.png".
